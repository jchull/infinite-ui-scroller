  <p>Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…</p>

  Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. You are the last hope of the universe.

  Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.
  For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!
  What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso!

  <p>Daddy Bender, we're hungry. And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet. Kif might! Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!

  <p>You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. Now what? I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Tell them I hate them.

  You lived before you met me?! No! The cat shelter's on to me. Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!

  Hey, guess what you're accessories to. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?

  Is the Space Pope reptilian!? What are their names? I'm a thing. Daylight and everything. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.

  Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. Can we have Bender Burgers again? Soothe us with sweet lies. Ow, my spirit! Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty?

  You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Soothe us with sweet lies. You wouldn't. Ask anyway!

  Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. Bender, quit destroying the universe! Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?

  THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!

  Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you?

  I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! I can explain. It's very valuable. And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it.
