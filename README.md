# infinite-ui-scroller
Infinite Scrolling is currently a popular and overplayed way to allow users to keep viewing web content without having to click.
 Clicking is very hard, so I wrote this Angular directive that loads the views you specify as the user scrolls
 with their atrophied finger comfortably. I really am making the world a better place.

# Simplicity
 _I strive to make things as simple as possible._

 The dependencies list is very short and does not include JQuery or any other unnecessary cruft.


# Getting started
- TODO:

# Sample project

# Using the directive
- states: (required) an array of strings, UI Router state names
- circular: (optional, default=true) if false, prevents returning to the first state after
the last state is reached

`<infinite-scroller states="[]" circular="true"></infinite-scroller>`

# Customizing the appearance
TODO: document custom styling
